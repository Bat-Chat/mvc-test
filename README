## Installation

1. Clone the project
2. I didn't add `.env` to gitignore for easier setup
3. Navigate to the project root directory and run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Install dependencies - `docker-compose exec app composer install`
5. Run migrations - `docker-compose exec app php dbSetup.php`
6. Open in browser http://127.0.0.1:8080
